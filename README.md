# WBLNA
Wide Bandwidth low noise amplifier 20Hz-20MHz 20/40dB
-----------------------------------------------------

The WBLNA is a low noise high bandwidth amplifier board.
It can be use to many purpose as noise measurement.

Specs are :

_20Hz to 20MHz -3dB bandwidth
_+20dB and +40dB gain individual outputs
_50 Ohms input/output impedance
_AC or DC coupled input (support +/-20V in AC coupled mode).
_Single 12V@50mA DC input jack
_Low overall cost (~30â‚¬ of parts + PCB).

This project  is open source and has been designed using Kicad 5.0.2.
The Githu repos include all design files like :
LTspice simulation files and results
Schematics, bill of materials with Mouser order code
Picture of prototype, pulse mesurements, mechanical drawing and more...

Enjoy !
